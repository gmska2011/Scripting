  * copy to another datastore
  * download to the local host
  * download into a deduplicated storage space
  * sync with the local host
  * sync with another ESXi host
  
* Fast backup through Internet with help of deduplication
* VM synchronization between backup host and ESXi server
  
Features to come
----------------

* Deduplication at storage level 
* VM synchronization between two ESXi hosts

Requirements
------------

bazaarvcb works on most Linux and Windows OS. It backup VMware ESXi 5.x.

ESXi 4.x will be partially supported if possible.

Download

Storage consideration
---------------------

Sparse files
++++++++++++

VM's disks contains some unused space, if this space contains zeros, bazzarvcb
can use sparse file to store these disk images. A freshly installed system
on a 1To disk will use only few Giga on the backup host. 

Deduplication
++++++++++++++

In the future bazaarvcb will be able to write to a self managed deduplicated repository.
Multiple VMs will be stored on the same repository and take benefit of block
sharing between VMs.   


Network setup
--------------

Then SSH service must be started on the ESXi host. *bazaarvcb* tunnels
the https connection into the SSH connection.
 
Because SSH is very CPU intensive, the ESXi agent try to open an un-encrypted
connection back to the backup host only for data. It it fail, then it fallback 
to the existing SSH connection.
The default port is 31031. This is the one used by VMotion and this port
is open on the ESXi by default. You must open this port on your backup host.
On Windows just reply yes to the popup Windows the first time you run bazaarVCB.
The reason why this is the ESXi host that open the data channel back to the
backup host is technical and could change in the future. 
If you need to use VMotion then use another port.
