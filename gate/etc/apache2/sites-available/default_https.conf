# Summary: Default server configuration for https
# Provides: VirtualHost
# Provides: VirtualHost-https
# Provides: VirtualHost-https-default
#

#
# This is the Apache server configuration file providing SSL support.
# It contains the configuration directives to instruct the server how to
# serve pages over an https connection. For detailing information about these
# directives see <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html>
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.

	## SSL Virtual Host Context
	##

	<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:443>

		#   General setup for the virtual host
		DocumentRoot "/usr/share/doc/indexhtml/"
		ServerName www.example.com:443
		ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
		ErrorLog "/var/log/apache2/error_default.log"
		TransferLog "/var/log/apache2/access_default.log"

		#   SSL Engine Switch:
		#   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
		SSLEngine on

		#   SSL Cipher Suite:
		#   List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
		#   See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
		SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL

		#   Server Certificate:
		#   Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
		#   the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
		#   pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  Keep
		#   in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you
		#   can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA
		#   ciphers, etc.)
		SSLCertificateFile "/etc/nginx/ssl/neo63.ru/neo63.ru.crt"

		#   Server Private Key:
		#   If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
		#   directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
		#   you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
		#   both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
		SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/nginx/ssl/neo63.ru/self-ssl.key"

		#   Server Certificate Chain:
		#   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
		#   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
		#   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
		#   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
		#   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
		#   certificate for convinience.
		#SSLCertificateChainFile "/etc/httpd2/conf/ssl.crt/ca.crt"

		#   Certificate Authority (CA):
		#   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
		#   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
		#   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
		#   Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks
		#         to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
		#         Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
		#SSLCACertificatePath "/etc/httpd2/conf/ssl.crt"
		#SSLCACertificateFile "/etc/httpd2/conf/ssl.crt/ca-bundle.crt"

		#   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
		#   Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client
		#   authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
		#   of them (file must be PEM encoded)
		#   Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks
		#         to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
		#         Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
		#SSLCARevocationPath "/etc/httpd2/conf/ssl.crl"
		#SSLCARevocationFile "/etc/httpd2/conf/ssl.crl/ca-bundle.crl"

		#   Client Authentication (Type):
		#   Client certificate verification type and depth.  Types are
		#   none, optional, require and optional_no_ca.  Depth is a
		#   number which specifies how deeply to verify the certificate
		#   issuer chain before deciding the certificate is not valid.
		#SSLVerifyClient require
		#SSLVerifyDepth  10

		#   Access Control:
		#   With SSLRequire you can do per-directory access control based
		#   on arbitrary complex boolean expressions containing server
		#   variable checks and other lookup directives.  The syntax is a
		#   mixture between C and Perl.  See the mod_ssl documentation
		#   for more details.
		#<Location />
		#SSLRequire (    %{SSL_CIPHER} !~ m/^(EXP|NULL)/ \
		#            and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_O} eq "Snake Oil, Ltd." \
		#            and %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_OU} in {"Staff", "CA", "Dev"} \
		#            and %{TIME_WDAY} >= 1 and %{TIME_WDAY} <= 5 \
		#            and %{TIME_HOUR} >= 8 and %{TIME_HOUR} <= 20       ) \
		#           or %{REMOTE_ADDR} =~ m/^192\.76\.162\.[0-9]+$/
		#</Location>

		#   SSL Engine Options:
		#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
		#   o FakeBasicAuth:
		#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
		#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
		#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
		#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
		#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
		#   o ExportCertData:
		#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
		#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
		#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
		#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
		#     into CGI scripts.
		#   o StdEnvVars:
		#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
		#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
		#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
		#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
		#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
		#   o StrictRequire:
		#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
		#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
		#     and no other module can change it.
		#   o OptRenegotiate:
		#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
		#     directives are used in per-directory context.
