#
# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#
#NameVirtualHost *:88

<VirtualHost *:88>
	#
	# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
	# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
	# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
	#
	ServerAdmin webmasterr@localhost

	#
	# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
	# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
	# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
	#
	# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
	#
	ServerName www.neo.rus:88

	#
	# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
	# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
	# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
	#
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
	#
	# Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect
	# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
	# directory (and its subdirectories).
	#
	# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of
	# features.
	#
	<Directory />
		# Summary: Configure for all dirs by default
		# Requires: Directory-root
	#	Include conf/extra-available/httpd-default.conf
	</Directory>

	#
	# Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow
	# particular features to be enabled - so if something's not working as
	# you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it
	# below.
	#

	#
	# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.

		# Redirect: Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to

		# will make a new request for the document at its new location.
		# Example:
		# Redirect permanent /foo http://www.example.com/bar

		#
		# Alias: Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to
		# access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.
		# Example:
		# Alias /webpath /full/filesystem/path
		#
		# If you include a trailing / on /webpath then the server will
		# require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely
		# need to provide a <Directory> section to allow access to
		# the filesystem path.

		#
		# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
		# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
		# documents in the target directory are treated as applications and
		# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the
		# client.  The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias
		# directives as to Alias.
