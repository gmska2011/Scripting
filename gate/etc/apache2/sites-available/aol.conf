# Summary: Use name-based virtual hosting for *:80
# Provides: NAGIOS
#

#
# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
#NameVirtualHost *:80
#ServerName /nagios
#DocumentRoot "/usr/share/nagios/html/"

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:88>
#	ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
	DocumentRoot "/home/web_aol/public_html/"
	ServerName aol3.neo63.ru
	ServerAlias www.aol3.neo63.ru
	ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd2/aol-error_log"
#	CustomLog "/var/log/httpd2/aol-access_log common"
</VirtualHost>
#
#<VirtualHost *:80>
#	ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host2.example.com
#	DocumentRoot "/var/www/vhosts/dummy-host.example.com"
#	ServerName dummy-host2.example.com
#	ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd2/dummy-host2.example.com-error_log"
#	CustomLog "/var/log/httpd2/dummy-host2.example.com-access_log common"
#</VirtualHost>
